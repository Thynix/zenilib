<!-- Fonts to load into the Fonts Database in Zenilib

For each entry in Fonts:

  1. 'token' should match the name you want to use in C++
  2. 'filepath' should be the path from within 'zenilib/'
  3. 'height' should be the number of pixels high you want the Font.
  4. 'bold' and 'italics' and boolean flags
     They are deprecated.
     It is much better to find bold/italicized versions of Fonts
     than to use this feature.

Only TrueType fonts are supported.
